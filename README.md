### Project Summary
<br>

*Motivation*
- To explore the use of different geo python libraries that provides simple services such as geocoding, route-finding, and map visualization

We propose a python application that allows geocoding from street addresses of location dataset. These geocoded locations will be mapped and be the basis for the main functionality of this project application - routing.

The routing functionality will perform route-finding from the user’s current location to a user defined location (selected from the map). The actual shortest route path will then be visualized on the map, and presented along with the measured distance (by bike, by car, or by walk). 


##### Team Members

Arellano, Carla Mae  [@cmmarellano] (https://www.github.com/cmmarellano) <br>
Adriko, Kennedy  [@adken] (https://www.github.com/adken)
<br>

### Methodology

<br>

Data Required:
- Administrative Addresses 
<br>

Study / Test Area:
- Austria
<br>

Python libraries:
- Geopy
- Folium
- Open Routes Service API
- Etc. (as needed)
<br>

Steps to be taken:
- Implement geocoding
- Plot geocoded locations on web map
- Implement routing from user location to selected location on the map
